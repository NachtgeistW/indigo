Nice to meet you. My name is NachtgeistW, a passionate game developer from China. I use Unity for work, and Godot to create my own games. My goal is to develop and create fun games with easy-to-read and well-designed code.

Outside of work, I love playing music rhythm games, especially BEMANI series and Rayark series. I also enjoy spending time reading, listening to VOCALOID songs and watching SoftwareTalk videos. These are relaxing hobbies that gives me a break from the fast-paced world of software engineering.
